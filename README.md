# Langchain-Chains---Runnables
LangChain Chains are sequences of connected components that process inputs step by step, allowing complex workflows like question answering or multi-step reasoning. Runnables are modular, executable building blocks in LangChain that can be run independently or composed into Chains for flexible and reusable pipelines.
